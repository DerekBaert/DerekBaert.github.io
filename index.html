								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My first gaming memories were playing my Super Nintendo with my brother, trying to find all the secrets in Donkey Kong Country 3. 
								My tastes have expanded to include many genres, particularly RPGs and Survival Horror, but I will always have a soft spot for the classics.</br>
								In my early 20's I started to learn more about Game Design from articles and videos online, which made me start to look at games in a different way. 
								This curiosity soon turned into a passion I knew I had to pursue. After a few years 'treading water,' I finally decided to just go for it and enroll in 
								my local college's Computer Science program. As luck would have it, a new Game Development program was starting just before I finished my first diploma, 
								and I enrolled in that as well.</br>							
								I've learned many things in my time in College, and I'm excited to learn even more in the industry.</br>						
								In my spare time I enjoy tabletop RPGs, cooking, exercising, and of course gaming. Some of my favourites are Silent Hill 2, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, 
								and Bloodborne.</p>
