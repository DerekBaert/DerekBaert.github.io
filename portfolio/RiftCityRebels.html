                        For this project each programmer was paired up with an artist who had interest in designing a character. For the other pairs, the artist came up with the visual and narrative concept for the character, while the programmer handled any special implementation the character required. I had a very strong idea for a heavy, nature themed character wearing a skull mask with a moveset inspired by wrestling and championed the idea. Luckily one of the artists was interested in the idea and volunteered to pair up with me.

                        To properly convey the idea I had, I created a <a href="https://pin.it/4DMHBPBaS">mood board</a> of reference photos to share with them. We needed a second ‘heavy’ character, so we agreed that Warden would fill this role. The artist created some silhouettes based on the reference photos, and after some revisions we eventually settled on one that would fit the heavy hitting playstyle we were going for. To connect his nature with his martial arts focused moveset, we put vines wrapped around his hands and feet like Muay Thai ropes.

                        For his moveset, we came up with a short list of wrestling moves and matched them to the input that we thought would be the best fit. As the game had a fantasy element, and to tie in his nature theme, we also gave him a few attacks that used vines he could summon from his hand or the ground.
I then researched the frame data for similar attacks in existing fighting games to determine the best starting point for the animations and compiled this on his design sheet. As the game was developed, these values were adjusted as needed.

                        One system I developed was the in-match camera. As there are multiple players moving around the screen during a match, this system needed to move the camera to follow the action of the match, zoom in and out to fit all characters on screen, and constrain the camera to the bounds of the level. Below I will cover how I tackled these behaviours.

                        To fit all characters on screen, the camera needs to zoom in when characters are close together and zoom out when they are far apart. First, I need to figure out what the furthest distance between any two players is. To do this, the camera loops through an array of all the players and checks the distance between each player. If this value exceeds the current value of the “CurrentDistance” local variable, it is assigned as the new value of CurrentDistance. Once the loops complete, the value of CurrentDistance is returned

                        Now that I know how far the two furthest players are, I need to figure out how far the camera can be allowed to zoom in or out. Since the two stages in our game are of vastly different size, I set up two instance variables so that the they could be adjusted to fit the needs of each stage.</br>
                        Using these two variables, I can now map the current maximum distance to a value between 0 and 1, with 0 being the Minimum player distance, and 1 being the maximum player distance. This value is clamped at 1 to prevent the camera zooming out further than intended. This value is then stored as a variable called ZoomAmount.

                        Rather than adjust the ‘zoom’ of the camera, I attached a spring arm component to the camera which shortens and lengthens to simulate the camera zooming in and out. Similar to determining the minimum and maximum player distance, I set up instance variables for the arm length so that it can be set per stage.</br>
                        Now, using the ZoomAmount value from earlier, I used a Lerp function to find the corresponding value between the minimum and maximum arm lengths, and set it as the spring arm’s current length with an FInterp function. This function smoothly changes the value of a float to a target value each frame, in this case the spring arm’s current length to the newly calculated length.

                        Now that the camera is zoomed to its desired value, it also needs to track the position of the players. To do this, we need to find the center point of all players in the match and smoothly move towards it. 
                        Finding the centre point is an easy task, as all that needs to be done is adding all player positions together and then dividing by the player count.

                        But what happens when one of the players is knocked out of bounds? The camera will move to follow them, potentially showing areas outside of the main play area. To fix this, I needed to find a way to set up boundaries for the camera that would adjust to match how far the camera was zoomed in or out.</br>
                        Using the ZoomAmount calculated earlier, I can easily calculate boundaries for the camera. First, I set up two collision boxes that represent the bounds for the camera when it is fully zoomed in and out. Like with the previous instance variables, these will be adjusted manually to fit the needs of the given level.

                      <p>
                        With these set, I use the X and Z bounds of each collision box as the minimum and maximum in a lerp function, and the ZoomAmount to find the corresponding size of the new boundaries. I then use these newly calculated boundaries to constrain the camera’s position by clamping its X and Z values.

                        Finally, I smoothly move the camera’s position to this constrained value using a VInterp function, which functions like the FInterp function used for the zoom.

                        Another feature I worked on was the integration of the cinematic sequences that would play at the character select screen and the results screen after a match. This system needed to determine which sequence to play based on which character it was for, as well as reflect which colour scheme the character was currently using. To do this, I created a Map which used the different character classes as keys, and their sequence for the character select or results screen as the value. When a character was selected, or a match was over, we would reference a struct of the player data which showed which player selected which character, and which colour variant they were using. With this we could easily look up which sequence to play, and change the material used by the character in the sequence to match the player's colour.

                        A major system I worked on for this project was the Game Manager systems, or 'Game Modes' in Unreal Engine. These consisted of two major Game Modes; the menu game mode and the match game mode
      The menu game mode handled all of the player selections in the menus leading up to the match itself. To handle this, I created a struct to track which character the player selected, as well as any in game statistics that could be used for balancing, or the players score. In the game mode, I then used these structs in a Map with the players controller ID as the key. This way, I could make sure the data in the struct was assigned to the correct player. This map was then transferred to the Game Mode for the match once it started. The Game Mode for the matches would track all of the players statistics. This included how many times they were knocked out, how many other players they knocked out, the damage they dealt, etc. This information was very useful after playtests, as we could compare how much damage the characters dealt, who won the most, and any other relevant comparisons to inform game balance. We also displayed some of this information to to the player after each match, so they could see how well they did.
